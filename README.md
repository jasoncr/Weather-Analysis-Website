# Web-Design-Challenge
For this challenge, I created 7 html pages and a corresponding css to showcase the results of a previous analysis. This website has the data, visualizations, and the conclusions from my python-api-challenge. 

The first webpage will be the landing page for the user. It should give project summary, a side bar with images are linked to one of the four scatter plots comparisons web pages, and a nav bar at the top. The nav bar allows the user to go to the same web pages as the side bar, as well as a comparison page and a page that displays the data used from a csv. I considered that this website might be viewed from a mobile device, therefore I made it responsive to a smaller screen. Below I included screen shots of both the landing page viewed from a large screen as well as a small screen.

All the pages include scatter plots of our previous work as well as an analysis. They also all link to each other.
