# Web-Design-Challenge
For this challenge, I created 7 html pages and a corresponding css to showcase the results of a previous analysis about how latitude changes affect weather. All the pages include scatter plots of our previous work as well as an analysis. They also all link to each other.  

Access the main page by going to:  [https://jasoncr.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/WebVisualizations/index.html](https://jasoncr.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/WebVisualizations/index.html)
